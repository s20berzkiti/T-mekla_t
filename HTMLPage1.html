                <p><em>Furby</em> is an American electronic robotic toy that was originally released in 1998 by Tiger Electronics. It resembles a hamster or owllike creature and went through a period of being a "must-have" toy following its holiday season launch, with continual sales until 2000.</p>
                <p>In recent years this strange looking toy has found an occult following with the now creative adults, who used to love the toy as children. Starting in 2018 with the creation of the "long furby". Tumblr user furbyfuzz, also known as Aloe, created the first LongFurby, with the initial thought of "What if Furby was.... longer...".  "She was an Idea that I just had to get out and onto paper". 5 months after drawing the concept, on May 14th, 2018, LongFurby was born. Aloe became famous within the furby community, and produced long furbys to sell. Many other people started making their own long furbys, developing a long furby community niche. There's even a dedicated website gallery for all the long furbies, longfurby.com.</p>
                <p>This sparked not only a renewed interest in the original furbies but furbies of all kinds. Now almost any type of furby can be found, long furbies, round furbies, furnies with human proportions and so on. The novelty and creepy aspects of these one of a kind creations can drive their prices into the hundreds of dollars.</p>
                <p>Making your own unique furby is a challenge of creativity and sowing.</p>
